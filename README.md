npm run dev
```

### Setup with devcontainer

The above setup can be used for development, but you can also setup dev env with using the [VS Code Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).

- Install VS code and the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers).
- [Optional] To share git credential with the container, run `ssh-add $HOME/.ssh/your_ssh_rsa`. See following for more info: https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/sharing-git-credentials
- Run the `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...` command from the Command Palette or quick actions Status bar item, and select the project folder.
- Wait until the building of the application is finished, then access the application url
